# Particulate Detection
Particulate Detection is a Python program for quantifying red particulate from an image.

## Installation
Fork or clone the repository on your local machine and run the particle-detection-main.py file from the command line.

## Usage
Select a .jpeg or .png file for measurement that includes red particles against a contrasting background and a scale bar or other feature of known length for calibration. 

Draw a line along the calibration feature and enter in the length and units in the command window. Select "Enter" when done. 

Drag and drop a rectangle along the region of interest for particle measurement. Ensure that this does not overlap with the calibration feature. Select "Enter" when done.

Output files will be saved in a new/existing folder in the image path directory titled with a date-time stamp. Close the overlay window when done to end the program.

## Troubleshooting
If the contrast between the background and the particles is not sufficient, try increasing the exposure to get better color contrast.
